# teamnode
This is a website for teams.  Framework is using html, css, js, and node.js.  The database is Sqlite3.

TeamNode is a node.js starter kit.  You won't find anything fancy here, just the way I start all my node.js projects. I know about complexity but I don't see the point if I'm constantly trying to figure out how it works instead of getting the features done. Node.js provides the environment to keep it simple.  The side effect, this kit provides a good starting point for learning.  I do hope you find this as a good starting point, or like me, a good project to fork.  Our team welcomes constructive feedback and participation!



## Run

```bash
 node db-init.js   -- This will create the Sqlite3 database with sample data.
 node app.js
 ```

## Thoughts
Well in my experience, every time you add a new third party tool, you tie yourself into that third party for the life expectancy of the product you’re developing. The lack of control and understanding of someone’s idea of good code which has been black boxed is very hard to deal with when something goes wrong (it always does) in the aforementioned black box. You will find many disclaimers attached to third party license agreements, "use at own risk" is one that I see often. 

If you can program the code yourself and most importantly understand the code, and the code can be developed in a reasonable amount of time, why would you use a third party tool? When bugs appear, you understand how things work and can track down the root problem. I am an engineer, I build code that sometimes breaks but shouldn't collapses. 

Frameworks are not "silver bullets". When you program against a Framework, you’re allowing someone else to take control of the big decisions about the code for you. Surely you can see that? These big decisions once made are very hard to retrace upon, if the framework is too encompassing then it will make all the major decisions for you. Using frameworks also obfuscate the actual programming away. Define your interpretation of a framework, there is more than one type of framework. Some frameworks are so integrated to the programming language then I would call these programming systems.  Depending on your context, and you would like to use a framework, take some time up front and find a framework that works for your team.  I too have made some decisions in this starter kit that you may want to use or change.

Some thoughts.  My goal is to keep close to node.js.  Go ahead and contribute or fork - add code or packages that meet your needs.  Go ahead and add issues too.  Enjoy the Code!  Brian.
